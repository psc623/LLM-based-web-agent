### Function
Open the browser as your setting(e.g.chrome) and follow your input instruction
### Some trial 
·Although I select deepseek as LLM,cmd bash keep tapping:OPENAI-API-KEY failed.Then I searched a tutorial on Youtube and the blogger told me to close"Use-Vision"button on web-ui because it will use chatgpt4 as defalt LLM.
·Firstly I used edge to open web-ui,but it will include some chrome tasks automatically,so I always fail to connect to Chrome.Then I switch to Firefox,then it works.
